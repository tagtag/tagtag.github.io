 Repositioning of COVID-19 drug using tensor decomposition based unsupervised feature extraction
</H1>
We performed in silico drug repositioning for COVID-19.
We identified genes whose expression altred by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
and drugs targeting these genes were screened as candidate drug compounds. 
They included many known anti-virus drugs as well as ivermectin that was under thectinical test presently.
